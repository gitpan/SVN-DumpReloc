=head1 NAME

svn-dump-reloc - rewrite paths in a Subversion dump

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  svn-dump-reloc from to [from1 to1 [...]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility modifies a repository dump, rewriting file paths in
accordance with the passed arguments.

It reads the original repository dump from stdin and writes the
modified dump to stdout.

It is useful to import a repository as a subdirectory of another
already existent one. For instance:

  $ svnadmin dump /my/repos | svn-dump-reloc "/" "my/project" >dump

will relocate all the files in the dump to the subdirectory
C<my/project>.

Or to rename or move directories:

  $ svnadmin dump /my/repos | svn-dump-reloc "foo/doz" "bar" >dump

that will move the files in the directory C<foo/doz> to C<bar> leaving
the rest untouched.

Paths are always absolute and there is no need to begin them with a
slash (C</>). For instance, C<foo> and C</foo> are equivalent.

This program does not check for colisions on the file tree and so, it
is possible to generate corrupted dumps when some target path overlaps
with another directory present in the dump.
