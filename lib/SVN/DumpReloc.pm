SVN::DumpReloc - Perl script to rewrite paths inside a Subversion dump

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ svn-dump-reloc from-path to-path <in-sv-dump >out-sv-dump


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is just a wrapper for the script L<svn-dump-reloc>.

If you are interested in having the same funcionality available as a
Perl module, drop me a mail and I would move it here... or even
better, send me a patch :-)))
